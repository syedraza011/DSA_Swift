//3. Write a program to count the occurrences of a specific character in a string.
//4. Given a string, find the first non-repeated character.
//5. Create a function that performs basic string encryption by shifting characters by a given number of positions in the alphabet.
//6. Write a program to find the longest palindrome substring in a given string.
//7. Implement a function to perform URL encoding, replacing spaces with "%20".
//8. Write a function to determine whether a string is a valid palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.
//9. Given a string containing numbers and words, find the sum of all the numbers in the string.
//10. Create a function to find the longest common prefix among an array of strings.
//11. Write a program to determine whether two strings are anagrams of each other, considering letter case and ignoring spaces.
//12. Given a string, convert it to "Title Case" (capitalize the first letter of each word).
//13. Implement a function to perform string pattern matching using the KMP algorithm.
//14. Write a program to check if a string is a rotation of another string.
//15. Create a function to reverse words in a sentence without reversing the individual characters.

//18. Write a program to find the longest substring with at most k distinct characters.
//19. Create a function to convert a sentence to Pig Latin: move the first letter of each word to the end and add "ay".
//20. Given a list of words, group them by anagrams.
//
//**Arrays:**
//
//1. Write a function to find the second largest element in an array of integers.

//7. Given an array of integers, rearrange the array so that the even numbers appear before the odd numbers.
//8. Write a function to move all zeroes to the end of an array while maintaining the relative order of other elements.
