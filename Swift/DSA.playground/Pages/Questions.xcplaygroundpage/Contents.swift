//**Arrays:**
//
//1. **Find Maximum and Minimum:** Write a function to find the maximum and minimum elements in an array of integers.
//
//2. **Even and Odd Sum:** Create a program that calculates the sum of even and odd numbers separately in an array of integers.
//
//3. **Array Reversal:** Write a function to reverse an array of elements. You should do this in-place, without using any additional memory.
//
//4. **Find Common Elements:** Write a function that finds common elements between two arrays.
//
//5. **Array Rotation:** Implement a function to rotate an array to the right by a given number of positions.
//
//6. **Remove Duplicates:** Write a program that removes duplicates from an array and returns a new array with unique elements.
//
//7. **Array Sorting:** Implement sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort) to sort an array of integers.
//
//These exercises cover a range of concepts related to strings and arrays, such as manipulation, comparison, counting, reversing, and more. They'll help you develop a better understanding of these data structures and build your problem-solving skills in Swift.



//Mapping Elements:
//Given an array of integers, create a new array where each element is doubled.
//
//Filtering Elements:
//From an array of strings, create a new array containing only strings with a length greater than 5 characters.
//
//Reducing Elements:
//Calculate the sum of all elements in an array of doubles.
//
//Compact Mapping:
//From an array of optional integers, create a new array containing only non-nil values.
//
//Flattening Arrays:
//Given an array of arrays of integers, create a single array containing all the elements from the subarrays.
//
//Sorting Custom Objects:
//Sort an array of Person objects based on their ages in ascending order.
//
//Performing an Action:
//Print each element of an array of strings on the console.
//
//Finding Specific Elements:
//Find the first negative number in an array of integers.
//
//Checking Conditions:
//Determine if all elements in an array of booleans are true.
//
//Finding Maximum and Minimum:
//Find the oldest person in an array of Person objects.
//
//Splitting Elements:
//Split an array of strings into two arrays: one containing strings with even lengths and the other with odd lengths.
//
//Joining Elements:
//Join an array of strings using a comma as a separator.
//
//Enumerating Elements:
//Print each element of an array of strings along with its index.
//
//Partitioning Elements:
//Given an array of integers, separate the positive numbers from the negative numbers.
//
//Using prefix and suffix:
//Get the first three elements and the last two elements from an array of characters.
